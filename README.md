# String Matching and Biological Sequence Alignment

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate different functionalities: String Matching and Biological Sequence Alignment.

## Basic String Matching

### File: `STRINGMATCHING.py`

This Python script defines a function, `string_match(string, substring)`, that finds occurrences of a substring within a given string. It uses a simple pattern matching algorithm to identify positions where the substring is found.

## Needleman-Wunsch Implementation

### File: `Needleman-Wunsch.py`

This code implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to find the optimal global alignment of two biological sequences and provides the aligned sequences along with the alignment score.
